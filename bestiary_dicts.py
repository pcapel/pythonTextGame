	'Goblin': """The goblin is a creature found in shallow caves and dark warrens.
They are generally smaller than men, but have fearsome limbs, sharp teeth, and keen eyes.  
They are capable of communication in the tongue of men, but it sounds harsh and forced.  
Their native tongue is a gruesome language that few men have been able to decode.  
Their skin is pale and almost translucent, and they have a smell that is reminiscent of raw or rotting flesh; 
generally attributed to their diet and poor hygeine.
They are also found deeper in caves and the dark places where evil congregates.  Most wear tattered clothing, 
not unlike human vagrants that they're known to feed on when opportunity presents.  They have dark eyes, and their
saliva is a dark milky brown which tends to seeth between their teeth during battles.
""",
	'Bear': """Bears are known to live deep in caves and to roam forests during certain times of year.
While the lumbering beasts are fairly easy to avoid in a fight, and have trouble avoiding damage,
they are incredibly strong and difficult to kill.  Their brown fur is normally clean, but there are 
a number of people who report bears with extremely matted fur who seem to move with an unusual grace.
Normal bears are usually 7 to 9 feet tall, when they stand on their hind legs.  Their paws will reach
quit a distance on the end of their long arms, and are large enough to rip a man's head clean off.""",
	'Demon': """The demon is a creature of pure and unadulterated evil.  They wander only the deepest depths of caves 
and are almost never found outside of the earth.  They reak of sulphur and are many times more powerful than all but the
strongest warriors.  Those that encounter demons are rarely lucky enough to survive.  Because of that, the legends around
their appearance are not all in agreement.  Some say that even looking at a demon is enough to cause you to burst into flames.
Other legends mention the lack of a truly corporeal form, and say that they are simply masses of truly living darkness."""
