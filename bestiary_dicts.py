	'Goblin': "The goblin is a creature found in shollow caves and dark warrens.  They are generally smaller than men, but have fearsome limbs, sharp teeth, and keen eyes.  They are capable of communication in the tongue of men, but it sounds harsh and forced.  Their native tongue is a gruesome language that few men have been able to decode.  Their skin is pale and almost translucent, and they have a smell that is reminiscent of raw or rotting flesh; generally attributed to their diet and poor hygeine."
