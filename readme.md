# A Text Game
A text based RPG you say?  Well, I figured it was a good way to learn!

I started this project shortly after I started to learn Python.  If I'm
being perfectly frank, that probably about the time I started to learn
how to program properly in the first place.  Prior to that, I had a little
bit of javascript that I knew how to write, and I wasn't very good at that
at all.

All that said, I'll probably get back to this in the near future to update it
according to all the new things that I know now.
